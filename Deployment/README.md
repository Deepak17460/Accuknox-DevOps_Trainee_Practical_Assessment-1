# Deploy Wisecow Application to Kubernetes using Helm

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the Wisecow application to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. By leveraging Helm, we simplify the deployment process and ensure a consistent and repeatable setup.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: A Kubernetes cluster set up on-premise or in the cloud.
- **Helm**: Installed on your local machine and configured with your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Docker**: Installed on your build and deployment servers.
- **Git**: Access to the Git repository where the Wisecow application and configuration files are stored.

## Setting Up Kubernetes and Helm
### Install Kubernetes
1. Follow the [Kubernetes installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) to set up your cluster.
2. Ensure all nodes are correctly configured and the cluster is operational.

### Install Helm
1. Follow the [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Helm on your local machine.
2. Configure Helm with your Kubernetes cluster.

### Configure Kubernetes Credentials
1. Ensure that Kubernetes credentials are available for Jenkins to interact with the cluster.
2. Store these credentials securely in Jenkins using the kubeconfig file.

## Deploying Wisecow Application using Helm
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the Git repository containing the Wisecow application and Helm chart:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deepak17460/Accuknox-DevOps_Trainee_Practical_Assessment-.git
cd Accuknox-DevOps_Trainee_Practical_Assessment-
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image
Build the Docker image for the Wisecow application:
```bash
docker build -t dpcode72/wisecow:1.0 .
docker push dpcode72/wisecow:1.0
```

### Step 3: Deploy with Helm
Deploy the Wisecow application to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm:
```bash
helm upgrade --install wisecow ./helm-chart --set image.repository=dpcode72/wisecow --set image.tag=1.0
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
Check the status of your deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully deployed the Wisecow application to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm. For any issues or further assistance, feel free to reach out.
